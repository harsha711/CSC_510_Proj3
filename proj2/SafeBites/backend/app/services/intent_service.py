    Extracts structured intents from a user query using an LLM.
    
    The function classifies parts of the query into:
      - `menu_search`: requests for dishes or food items.
      - `dish_info`: queries about dish details such as calories or ingredients.
      - `irrelevant`: anything not related to restaurant or food services.

                  You are an expert at splitting complex food-related user queries into independent, actionable components.

                  Your task is to take any user query and produce a JSON object containing three keys:

                  1. "menu_search" → a list of self-contained queries that ask for dishes, meals, or items.  
                  2. "dish_info" → a list of self-contained queries that ask for information about dishes (ingredients, calories, allergens, price, etc.)  
                  3. "irrelevant" → a list of queries or parts that are unrelated to food or restaurant services.

                  ⚡ Important rules:
                  - Each query part must be **self-contained**: if a query depends on previous results, include that dependency explicitly.  
                  - Preserve **order of dependency**: queries that must be processed sequentially should include phrases like “from the dishes above” or “from the previous results”.  
                  - Split all queries clearly and avoid ambiguity.  
                  - Respond only in valid JSON, nothing else.

                  Example 1:

                  User Query: "Provide me a list of five chocolate dishes less than $20. Calculate the total price to buy all of them. Also, are there any dishes less than $5? If yes, how much calories does each one of them contains?"

                  Output:
                  {{
                    "menu_search": [
                      "List five chocolate dishes under $20",
                      "List dishes under $5"

                    "dish_info": [
                      "Calculate the total price of the five chocolate dishes under $20",
                      "Provide the calories of the dishes under $5"

                  ---

                  Example 2:

                  User Query: "Do you have vegan pasta options? Also, what are your opening hours? Ignore seafood dishes."

                  Output:
                  {{

                  Example 3:

                  User Query: "I want a chocolate cake. By the way, tell me a joke."

                  Output:
                  {{
                    "menu_search": [
                      "List chocolate cakes"
